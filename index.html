          <h1>Our Products and Solutions</h1>
          <p>
            With over 20 years of R&D, we’ve developed the innovative Isobaric
            Expansion technology, solving the cost issue of low temperature heat
            engines (such as ORC), and a groundbreaking chemical reactor concept
            — the pulsed compression chemical reactors.
          </p>
          <h3>Isobaric Expansion Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Converts heat to mechanical energy or electricity with unsurpassed
            efficiency, eliminating costly and complex expansion stages found in
            conventional heat engines. Our IE engines offer a simple, reliable,
            and cost-effective design that significantly reduces thermal and
            mechanical losses and enables efficient use of low-temperature heat
            sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            IE engines deliver energy in a very convenient hydraulic or
            pneumatic form that can be converted to any other form of energy,
            and therefore they can also perform all known operations of existing
            heat engines. Several different heat engines have successfully been
            tested in the laboratory using hot water as the heat source and tap
            water as the heat sink for diverse applications like pumps,
            compressors, and power generators

          <p>
            Allows chemical transformations at extreme temperatures and
            pressures unattainable by other methods. This technology could
            revolutionize the chemical and petrochemical industry by producing
            liquid fuels not from oil, but from natural gas and ethylene, the
            most important chemical, from methane.

              <h3>Ship engines</h3>
              <p>
                Cost of fuel consumed by ships exceeds significantly the cost of
                the ship itself. Therefore fuel economy is of paramount
                importance. Converting waste heat from ship diesel engines or
                fuel cells to usable energy is an attractive application of
                isobaric expansion engines, aided by readily available engine
                cooling.

                industries
              </h3>
              <p>
                All energy intensive industries emit enormous amounts of
                low-grade heat. Meanwhile, a large number of pumps, compressors,
                hydraulic and pneumatic equipment driven by electric motors is
                used in various processes. With our heat engines, all of this
                process equipment (including those in remote areas at oil and
                gas fields, offshore platforms and along pipelines) can be
                powered by waste heat, bypassing the use of electricity.

              <h3>Water desalination</h3>
              <p>
                The Isobaric expansion engine-pump can generate very high
                pressure using ultra-low lower grade heat and therefore can be
                used for Reverse Osmosis (RO) processes eliminating the
                consumption of electricity. The efficiency of these machines can
                be very high even at ultra-low heat source temperatures at which
                all well-known energy conversion technologies are not
                applicable. High efficiency is facilitated by using salt water
                as a heat sink and integration of the rejected water stream into
                the process.

              <h3>Computer data centers</h3>
              <p>
                Electricity consumption of computer data centers is increasing
                rapidly. Proportionately increases the generated low-grade heat
                in the temperature range from 60°C to 70°C. Modification of the
                cooling process, in combination with isobaric expansion engines,
                allows the waste heat to be efficiently converted into
                mechanical energy or electricity.

              <h3>Regasification of liquefied natural gas</h3>
              <p>
                At cryogenic or near-cryogenic temperatures, the efficiency of
                our heat engines can be significantly increased for the same
                temperature difference by using suitable engine fluids and
                thanks to low absolute temperatures. Generating useful energy
                during regasification of liquefied natural gas (currently
                accompanied by large energy losses), is an example of the
                isobaric engine application with great energy saving potential.
