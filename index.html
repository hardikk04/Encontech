          <h1>Our Products and Solutions</h1>
          <p>
            With over 20 years of R&D, we’ve developed the innovative Isobaric
            Expansion technology, solving the cost issue of low temperature heat
            engines (such as ORC), and a groundbreaking chemical reactor concept
            — the pulsed compression chemical reactors.
          </p>
          <h3>Isobaric Expansion Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Converts heat to mechanical energy or electricity with unsurpassed
            efficiency, eliminating costly and complex expansion stages found in
            conventional heat engines. Our IE engines offer a simple, reliable,
            and cost-effective design that significantly reduces thermal and
            mechanical losses and enables efficient use of low-temperature heat
            sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            IE engines deliver energy in a very convenient hydraulic or
            pneumatic form that can be converted to any other form of energy,
            and therefore they can also perform all known operations of existing
            heat engines. Several different heat engines have successfully been
            tested in the laboratory using hot water as the heat source and tap
            water as the heat sink for diverse applications like pumps,
            compressors, and power generators

          <h3>Pulsed Compression Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Allows chemical transformations at extreme temperatures and
            pressures unattainable by other methods. This technology could
            revolutionize the chemical and petrochemical industry by producing
            liquid fuels not from oil, but from natural gas and ethylene, the
            most important chemical, from methane.
